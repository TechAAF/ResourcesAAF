#How to Run the project locally on you system
 - Create a virtual enviornment using venv/virtualenv.
 - Activate the enviornment.
 - Run this command : pip install -r requirements.txt
 - Add a .env file to the project, and add all the secret keys. 
 - The keys that needs to be added in the .env file can be found in the settings.py file, the ones using the config function to get their values.
